    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 7% of mark for class (with 6% on correctness + 1% on quality and efficiency of your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=http://nltk.org/book>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place."

    "The first filtering is based on document frequencies in the Brown corpus, in order to remove rare words. In this homework, we will be treating the paragraphs of the Brown corpus as our \"documents\". You can iterate over them by using the `paras` method of the corpus reader. You should remove tokens that are not alphabetic. Tokens should be lower-cased and lemmatized. Now calculate document frequencies for each word type, and use this to remove from your word similarity data any word pairs where at least one of the two words has a document frequency of less than 8 in this corpus.\n",

Note that a synset can be associated with multiple lemmas. You should only consider the count of your lemma. Also, you should remove any words where the primary sense is not a noun (this information is also in the synset).

You can use the Distributed Semantics notebook as a starting point, but note that since you are interested here in word semantics, you will be constructing a matrix where the (non-sparse) rows correspond to words in the vocabulary, and the (sparse) columns correspond to the texts where they appear (this is the opposite of the notebook). Again, use the Brown corpus, in the same format as with PMI and document frequency. After you have a matrix in the correct format, use `truncatedSVD` in `sklearn` to produce dense vectors of length k = 500, and then use cosine similarity to produce similarities for your word pairs. \n",
